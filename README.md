# BioD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biod/BioD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biod/BioD) [![DUB Package](https://img.shields.io/badge/dub-v0.1.0-red.svg)](https://code.dlang.org/packages/biod)

[BioD](https://github.com/biod/BioD) is a fast and memory efficient bioinformatics library written in the [D programming language](http://www.dlang.org)
whose aim is to:

* Provide a platform for developing high-performance computational biology applications using the [D programming language](http://www.dlang.org) through 
  - Automatic parallelization of tasks where possible
  - Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations

## Why D?

[D](http://www.dlang.org) is a language that suits parallel programming
because  the compiler provides certain guarantees. The D programmming language offers multi-paradigm programming features 
and can be considered as both a low and high-level
hybrid object orientated and functional (OOP/FP) programming language. D's templating/generics features are
far easier than that of C++.

## D programming language resources

## Current development
Our aim is to provide several modules to work with biological datasets for example
one of our main focus is to provide a modules for working with high throughput sequencing for example a
native bamreader and bamwriter that is really fast and easy to use. With D we have an good way to write performance parsers, particularly with three typical scenarios:

1. Go through a BAM file a read at a time
2. Go through a BAM file a nucleotide at a time (pileup)
3. Go through a BAM file with a sliding window

The sliding window is a derivation of the first - a read at a time or
a nucleotide at a time.


# Install

The current default is to provide the path to the checked out repo to the D-compiler. For example
in sambamba we use

    DFLAGS = -wi -I. -IBioD -g

# Usage

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/biod/BioD/tree/master/examples)
for examples and usage.

BioD is also a crucial part of the [sambamba](https://github.com/biod/sambamba) tool.
